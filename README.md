# Pixel Mapulator

A WYSIWYG in browser pixel map generator and more.

## Explanation

When working with large LED screen systems it is helpful to have an image that matches the size of the screen pixel for pixel that can be shared with the team involved with the installation of the screen as well as those designing video content for the screen to ensure that content produced for the screen will display as expected.

While many tools to help generate pixel maps for LED screens exist, I thought building one in browser would make it more accessible to all.

### Usage

Enter the width and height of the LED screen you want to generate a pixel map for. 
Edit the map as desired, using the available options.
Download a PNG to be used with your project when ready.
